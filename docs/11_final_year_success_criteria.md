# What Final-Year Examiners Usually Expect

## 1. High-Scoring Characteristics
1. Clear problem definition with practical relevance.
2. Strong link between literature and design decisions.
3. Measurable objectives and reproducible experiments.
4. Honest analysis of limitations and failures.
5. Working prototype with clean architecture.
6. Professional report structure and citation quality.
7. Strong viva communication with evidence-backed claims.

## 2. Marking-Friendly Evidence You Should Show
- Comparative baseline vs RAG tables.
- Ablation/tuning evidence (top-k, chunk size).
- Latency/cost tradeoff plots.
- Error analysis examples.
- Reproducibility steps and repo structure.

## 3. Common Reasons Projects Lose Marks
- Only implementation, no experimental rigor.
- Claims without quantitative evidence.
- Weak literature integration.
- No limitation discussion.
- Last-minute documentation.

## 4. Your Package in This Repo Covers
- Proposal and literature review.
- System design and methodology.
- Experiment scripts and metrics.
- Timeline, risk, ethics, viva prep.
- Dissertation writing template.

## 5. How to Push This to Distinction Level
1. Add a domain-specific curated dataset and gold QA annotations.
2. Add one stronger evaluation method (human scoring or entailment model).
3. Include statistical significance tests for key comparisons.
4. Add a polished deployment demo with logs/monitoring.
