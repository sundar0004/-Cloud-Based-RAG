Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines retrieval and generation.
In RAG, the system retrieves relevant context documents and injects them into the prompt.
This helps reduce hallucination by grounding answers in evidence.
FAISS is commonly used as a vector index for similarity search.
